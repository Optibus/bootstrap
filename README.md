# bootstrap


## Requirements

This is a simple script that will setup the minimum set of requirements needed to download and run the Optibus self-installed development environment. Some requirements are needed before you continue:

### Github

Create a github account to be added to the Github account. This account should use your Optibus email. With that in hand, ask your manager to add you to the Optibus organization in github.

Make sure this account has an SSH key associated with it. You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

## Running

```bash
  eval "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Optibus/bootstrap/refs/heads/main/bootstrap.sh)"
```
